This project is a way for me to show that I understand the concept and how to code using Bootstrap. 

The key features are as followed:
*Resgitration Forms: using gird layout, validation classes and btn-success
* Data tables: using hard-code user data, stripped and hoverable rows and having it be responsive using table-responsive div
* Images: having them be responsive images using img-fluid class, placing the image inside a fluid container to strech across the page and add a circular image.
* Buttons: created 2 buttons. One visiable on all screens and the other to be hidden on smaller screens.
* Navigation Bar: created a nav bar that has links to home, about and contacts. Make sure that it collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller scrrens using the bootstrap utilities and components to style the nav bar
